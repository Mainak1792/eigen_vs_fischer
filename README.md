# eigenspace_vs_fischerspace
This Project is a part of ELL784 assingments, floated by [Prof.Sumantra Dutta Roy](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sumantra/).
For the supervised case, try to find the best separating hyper-plane. For the unsupervised case, try to find the corresponding decision boundary. Look at cluster centres, and distances. This assignment will also require you to divide the dataset into training and testing sets, for instance.
